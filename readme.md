# t4corun ZMK Config

Relearning ZMK after a long hiatus (2023) because of the dongle. Setting up a XIAO Dongle setup for a GEIST Totem. 

This won't be a straight fork of [GEIGEIGEIST's](https://github.com/GEIGEIGEIST/zmk-config-totem) or [eigatech's](https://github.com/eigatech/zmk-config) repositories as I want to make it per ZMK's latest structure.

## Learnings

- `boards` are now under zmk-config root instead of inside `/config/`. Why?
- The totem is a composite board
